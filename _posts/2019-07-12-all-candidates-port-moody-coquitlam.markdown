I'm running around putting an All Candidates debate on for the Port Moody Coquitlam area.  The topic
will be the climate crisis, and I'm hoping to do it under the umbrella of [100 Debates][hundred].

You can send me ideas and feedback at warrenwilkinson@gmail.com or on
[Reddit Port Moody][portmoody] or [Reddit Coquitlam][coquitlam].
