I'm running around putting an All Candidates debate on for the Port Moody Coquitlam area.  The topic
will be the climate crisis, and I'm hoping to do it under the umbrella of [100 Debates][hundred].

You can find [The facebook page][facebook] under the name Interest Group for an All Candidate Port Moody Coquitlam Debate.  But also feel free to send me ideas and feedback at warrenwilkinson@gmail.com or on
[Reddit Port Moody][portmoody] or [Reddit Coquitlam][coquitlam].

If you're not on facebook, but want the occasional update email, please fill in my
[Outreach Form][outreachform].
