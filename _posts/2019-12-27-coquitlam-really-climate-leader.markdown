title:  "Is Coquitlam really a Climate Leader?"

This blog has been neglected.  I'm going to try to relaunch it as a
bit of an aggregator for Tri-Cities (e.g. Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam,
Port Moody) climate related news.

So, what's new?

Recently [Force Of Nature][fon] approached the Coquitlam's City
Council asking for stronger climate targets.

However, council claims they are climate leaders. Who is right?

"Coquitlam was an early signatory (back in 2007) to the Climate Action
Charter under the Green Communities Committee.  And two years ago,
Coquitlam was awarded the designation of Climate Leader, the
second-highest level, and we continue to make improvements."

I guess they're refering to the [2018 CARIP report][carip]. In
Appendix A (page 20) Coquitlam is listed as 'ACCLERATING PROGRESS ON
CHARTER COMMITMENTS' (the typo in ACCELERATING is in the report).
This is the sole category found between categories "CARBON NEUTRAL"
and "MEASURING GHG EMISSIONS".

My guess is we are designated a "Climate Leader" because we measure
GHGs and did something (anything) to reduce GHG emissions.

So I think [Force of Nature][fon] is correct on this: Coquitlam isn't
taking strong enough action.  I'll continue supporting Force of Nature
on this.
